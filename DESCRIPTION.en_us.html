  UnifrakturCook is a blackletter font.
It is based on Peter Wiegel&acirc;&euro;&trade;s font<a href="http://www.peter-wiegel.de/KochFraktur.html">Koch fette deutsche Schrift</a> which is in turn based on a 1910 typeface by Rudolf Koch. While the glyph design of Peter Wiegel&acirc;&euro;&trade;s font has hardly been changed at all, UnifrakturCook uses smart font technologies for displaying the font&acirc;&euro;&trade;s ligatures (OpenType, Apple Advanced Typography and SIL Graphite). An experimental feature is the distinction of good blackletter typography between required ligatures &acirc;&euro;&sup1;ch, ck, &Aring;&iquest;t, tz&acirc;&euro;&ordm; that must be kept when letterspacing is increased, and regular ligatures (for instance, &acirc;&euro;&sup1;fi, fl&acirc;&euro;&ordm;) that are broken up when letterspacing is increased.
</p>
<p>
  Using the ligatures: Whenever you type a sequence such as &acirc;&euro;&sup1;tz&acirc;&euro;&ordm;, it will automatically be displayed as a ligature.
When you want to oppress a ligature, for instance in the German word &Acirc;&laquo;Zeitzone&Acirc;&raquo; &acirc;&euro;&tilde;time zone&acirc;&euro;&trade; that should have no tz-ligature, then you put a<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-width_non-joiner">zero width non-joiner</a> between the &acirc;&euro;&sup1;t&acirc;&euro;&ordm; and the &acirc;&euro;&sup1;z&acirc;&euro;&ordm; or, alternatively, you write &Acirc;&laquo;Zeit&amp;zwnj;zone&Acirc;&raquo; in the HTML code. Unfortunately, this will only work on a browser that is capable of displaying ligatures.

<p>
  Of course, UnifrakturMaguntia provides the character &acirc;&euro;&sup1;&Aring;&iquest;&acirc;&euro;&ordm; (U+017F LATIN SMALL LETTER LONG S)!

  UnifrakturCook is optimized for @font-face linking on the internet by combining standards compliance with a permissive license.
